# Repository for some macro papers replications

At the most part of folders, the main language used was eviews and R. At others, i have been used MATLAB. 

The main focus of this repository is to replicate macroeconomics papers, some of them semi structural models for monetary policies. Yet, i have focused on working papers of the Brazilian Central Bank.

The responsibility for the codes are on my own. Any doubt or suggestion is very welcome.
